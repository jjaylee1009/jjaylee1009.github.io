        <h1>Seven Kinds of Contrast</h1>

            <h4>Dair first explains the "elements of harmony" (a consistent relationship between the black strokes of the letters 
            on a page and the space around them; and any rules, frames, or decorations being similar in style to the type), 
            then goes on to show 
            <a href="contrast/contrast.html">seven different kinds of contrast.</a> He emphasizes that in any kind of differentiation, 
            it's important to make the contrast obvious -- not just a slight change, an almost imperceptible variation, 
            but a really big, obvious difference between the contrasting elements.</h4>
