        <h1 class="seven">Seven Kinds <br>of Contrast</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Dair first explains the "elements of harmony" (a consistent relationship between the black strokes of the letters 
        on a page and the space around them; and any rules, frames, or decorations being similar in style to the type), 
        then goes on to show 
        <a href="contrast/contrast.html">seven different kinds of contrast.</a> He emphasizes that in any kind of differentiation, 
        it's important to make the contrast obvious -- not just a slight change, an almost imperceptible variation, 
        but a really big, obvious difference between the contrasting elements.</p>
